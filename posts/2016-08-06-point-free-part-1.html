<p><em>This is the first post in a series about <strong>tacit programming</strong> and <strong>point-free</strong> syntax in Haskell and other languages.</em></p>
<p>For an initial understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming">tacit programming</a>, consider that a synonym for tacit is <strong>quiet</strong> and an antonym is <strong>noisy</strong>. Code is noisy when it contains more information than we need to see. It’s quiet…when it doesn’t.</p>
<p>One way of producing tacit code is to write function definitions in a <strong>point-free</strong> style.</p>
<p>As opposed to a <strong>point-ful</strong> definition, a point-free definition is tacit because it tells you about the function without mentioning one or more of its arguments.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a point-ful definition:</p>
<pre><code>lengths ls = map length ls</code></pre>
<p>Here is its point-free equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>lengths = map lengths</code></pre>
<p>These definitions are semantically equivalent; the only difference is the syntax.</p>
<p>Both of them have this type:</p>
<pre><code>lengths :: Foldable t =&gt; [t a] -&gt; [Int]</code></pre>
<p>In other words, <code>lengths</code> receives a list of foldable structures containing values of some generic type and returns a list of <code>Int</code>.</p>
<p>The point-ful and point-free definitions mean the same thing, but they communicate differently.</p>
<p>You could read the first definition as:</p>
<p>“<code>lengths</code> is a function that maps each foldable structure in a list to its <code>length</code>.”</p>
<p>You could read the second as:</p>
<p>“<code>lengths</code> is a map of <code>length</code>.”</p>
<p>Consider the succinctness of the second version. It’s shorter and quicker to say, but understanding it requires that you how <code>map</code> acts on the elements of a list.</p>
<h2 id="calibrating-abstraction">Calibrating Abstraction</h2>
<p>Here’s another example:</p>
<pre><code>sum xs = foldr (+) 0 xs</code></pre>
<p>“<code>sum</code> is a function that iterates over <code>xs</code> to add up its elements, starting from zero and proceeding from right to left.”</p>
<p>Or you could say:</p>
<pre><code>sum = foldr (+) 0</code></pre>
<p>“<code>sum</code> is a right-fold of addition starting from zero.”</p>
<p>Both define the same function. But when we leave out the <code>xs</code>, we communicate at a higher level of abstraction.</p>
<p><strong>We are no longer talking about what <code>sum</code> does, but what it is:</strong> a fold with certain properties.</p>
<p>Let’s combine these two functions to make a new one:</p>
<pre><code>totalNumber ls = foldr (+) 0 (map length ls)</code></pre>
<p>By substituting in our definitions for <code>sum</code> and <code>lengths</code>, we get</p>
<pre><code>totalNumber ls = sum (lengths ls)</code></pre>
<p>And of course, we can make this look a little more like Haskell by using <code>$</code>.</p>
<pre><code>totalNumber ls = sum $ lengths ls</code></pre>
<p>You could say it’s quieter with the <code>$</code>, but it’s not point-free yet. <code>totalNumber</code> is defined in relation to its argument <code>ls</code>: “<code>totalNumber</code> receives a list of foldable structures and returns the <code>sum</code> of the <code>lengths</code> of those structures.”</p>
<p>But then, you could also just say, “<code>totalNumber</code> is the <strong>composition</strong> of <code>sum</code> and <code>lengths</code>.” How do we get there?</p>
<pre><code>totalNumber ls =        sum $ lengths ls
totalNumber ls =        sum . lengths $ ls
totalNumber    = \ls -&gt; sum . lengths $ ls
totalNumber    =        sum . lengths</code></pre>
<p>This is the process of <strong>eta-reduction</strong>: converting a point-ful definition to a point-free one. Here it takes three steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First, we notice that applying <code>sum</code> to <code>lengths ls</code> is equivalent to applying the composition <code>sum . lengths</code> directly to <code>ls</code>.</li>
<li>Next, we consider that <code>totalNumber</code> is a function that receives <code>ls</code> and simply applies an expression to it.</li>
<li>Finally, we drop the unnecessary lambda, removing <code>ls</code> from the definition.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eta-reduction, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#.CE.B7-conversion">eta-conversion</a> is a simply mechanical process–which means computers can do it!</p>
<p>In fact, you don’t have to do any of your eta-reduction yourself. Haskell’s <a href="https://github.com/bmillwood/pointfree"><code>pointfree</code></a> library can do it for you!</p>
